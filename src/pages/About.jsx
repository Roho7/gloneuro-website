          We are an innovative organization founded by Neuroscience think tanks,
          researchers, and educationists who have been associated with the
          worldâ€™s key Neuroscience organizations, including the multi-lateral
          bodies. Our aim is to spread brain awareness, knowledge, and enhance
          the quality of brain health through public engagement, along with
          updating neuroscience students and scientists with opportunities,
          latest research, and upskilling. We follow an enthusiastic
          volunteer-based ecosystem approach to bring positive changes in the
          career of all interested in Neurosciences. Our team wishes to be known
          for easy-to-understand brain health facts and informative works.
